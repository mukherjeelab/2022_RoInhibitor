# 2022_RoInhibitor

Processed data and code for:  
Small molecule inhibition of multiple RNA binding proteins underlies Musashi-2 independent phenotypes
All scripts were tested and work with R-3.6.1. Most of them also work with newer versions,
tested with R-4.1.3, however some issues were found with functions that require KEGG access:
keggList from KEGGREST library, enrichKEGG from clusterProfiler library and pathview from pathview library.
